The plugin allows you to publish the Release APK file to the Huawei AppGallery.

For publication the plugin used [Huawei Publish API (v2)](https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/en/doc/development/AppGallery-connect-References/agcapi-appid-list_v2)

Support `Gradle v4.1+` 

# Versions

```
LAST_RELEASE_VERSION = 1.0.0
```
```
LAST_SNAPSHOT_VERSION = 1.1.0-SNAPSHOT
```
# Adding the plugin to your project

in `./app/build.gradle`

```
apply plugin: 'com.android.application'
apply plugin: 'ru.cian.huawei-publish'

huaweiPublish {
    instances {
        release {
            credentialsPath = "$rootDir/huawei-credentials-release.json"
        }
        debug {
            credentialsPath = "$rootDir/huawei-credentials-debug.json"
        }
    }
}
```

Plugin supports different settings for different buildType and flavors.
For example, for `demo` and `full` flavors and `release` buildType just change instances like that:
```
huaweiPublish {
    instances {
        demoRelease {
            credentialsPath = "$rootDir/huawei-credentials-demo-release.json"
        }
        fullRelease {
            credentialsPath = "$rootDir/huawei-credentials-full-release.json"
        }
    }
}
```

File `huawei-credentials.json` contains next json structure:
```
{
  "client_id": "<CLIENT_ID>",
  "client_key": "<CLIENT_KEY>"
}
```
Credentials you should get at Huawei AppGallery Developer Console.  

#### For Release Plugin version
```
buildscript {
    repositories {
        mavenCentral() // or jcenter()
    }

    dependencies {
        classpath "ru.cian:huawei-publish-gradle-plugin:<LAST_RELEASE_VERSION>"
    }
}
```
